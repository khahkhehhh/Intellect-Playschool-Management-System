## Project Experience

In charge of the Kids' Registration module, I was responsible for developing functionalities that allow parents or guardians to register their children online. This involved creating a user-friendly interface for filling out registration forms, which included necessary information such as personal details of the child, contact information, and emergency contacts. Additionally, I implemented features that enable administrators to manage the registration process efficiently. This includes processing registration submissions, updating the status of registrations (received, approved, rejected, cancelled), and providing options for parents to update or delete their submitted registration forms.

In the Kid's Assessment module, my responsibilities included designing and implementing functionalities for staff to record assessments of the children enrolled in the playschool. This involved incorporating assessment methods such as V.A.K. (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) and Multiple Intelligence observation and review.
I developed features that allow staff to input assessment data, including comments, achievement levels, and manner status for each child. Additionally, I ensured that guardians could easily access their child's assessment reports through the system, providing transparency and insight into their child's progress.
Throughout the development process of both modules, I collaborated closely with team members to ensure seamless integration with other system components and adherence to project requirements and timelines. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into system development, user experience design, and effective collaboration within a team environment.
